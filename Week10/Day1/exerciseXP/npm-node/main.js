// Create a new folder called - npm-node
// Create a JS file called - main.js
// Add the following code to the file main.js :

// const a = 5;
// const b = 10;


// Write some more code in the main.js file so when you run it in the command prompt it logs Hello you are 15

const a = 5;
const b = 10;

console.log(`Hello you are ${a+b}`);


// Create a package.json file - use npm init
// Run the main.js file using npm start.
// Tip: you need to change the package.json file in order to achieve this.
// You should output something in the command prompt, for example: Hi! How are you ?


console.log(`Hi! How are you ?`);


//3 ex in another folder: npm-nodemon
