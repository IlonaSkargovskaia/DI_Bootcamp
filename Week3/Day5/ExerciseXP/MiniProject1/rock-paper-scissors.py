#What You Will Create
# Mini-Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors
# Rock-paper-scissors is an old game that can be played between two people. You can read about it in wikipedia

# We will create a game for the user to play Rock-paper-scissors against the computer.

# The user will input his/her move (rock/paper/scissors),
# and the computer will select either rock, paper or scissors at random.
# We will then compare the user’s move with the computer’s move, and determine the results of the game:

# The user won

# The computer won (the user lost)
# A draw (tie)
# We will print the outcome of each game: the user’s choice, the computer’s choice, and the result.

# The user will be able to play again and again. Once the user decides to exit the program, we will print a summary of the outcomes of all the games: how many times they won, lost or and tied the computer.
