#1. Create another cat breed named Siamese which inherits from the Cat class.
# Create a list called all_cats, which holds three cat instances : one Bengal, one Chartreux and one Siamese.
# Those three cats are Sara’s pets. Create a variable called sara_pets which value is an instance of the Pet class, and pass the variable all_cats to the new instance.
# Take all the cats for a walk, use the walk method.

# EX 2
# 1. Create a class called Dog with the following attributes name, age, weight.
# 2. Implement the following methods in the Dog class:
#   - bark: returns a string which states: “<dog_name> is barking”.
#   - run_speed: returns the dogs running speed (weight/age*10).
#   - fight : takes a parameter which value is another Dog instance, called other_dog. This method returns a string stating which dog won the fight. The winner should be the dog with the higher run_speed x weight.
#
# 3. Create 3 dogs and run them through your class.

# EX 3
# 1. Create a new python file and import your Dog class from the previous exercise.
# 2. In the new python file, create a class named PetDog that inherits from Dog.
# 3. Add an attribute called trained to the __init__ method, this attribute is a boolean and the value should be False by default.
# 4. Add the following methods:
#   - train: prints the output of bark and switches the trained boolean to True
#
#   - play: takes a parameter which value is a few names of other Dog instances (use *args). The method should print the following string: “dog_names all play together”.
#
#   - do_a_trick: If the dog is trained the method should print one of the following sentences at random:
#       - “dog_name does a barrel roll”.
#       - “dog_name stands on his back legs”.
#       - “dog_name shakes your hand”.
#       - “dog_name plays dead”.
